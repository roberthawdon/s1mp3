<h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

<h4>How to change my player's images?</h4>
<p>Run s1res and choose the "<i>Import Firmware...</i>" from the "<i>File</i>" menu and follow the wizard.
  Once completed, you should be able to see your player's firmware content. Now edit the files
  before you run the "<i>Export Firmware...</i>" wizard, which brings the changes back to your player.
  </p>

<h4>I opened an image for editing, but whenever i choose "<i>Close</i>" from the "<i>Edit</i>" menu, nothing happens!?</h4>
<p>The close function isn't able to find and close the external image editor, which was used to open
  your image resource. Anyway, it closes the file internally by finally reading any file changes.
  If the resource is still in use, further changes to the file won't get noticed.
  </p>

<h4>I see the resource icons inside the right window of s1res, but how do i edit them?</h4>
<p>The usual way should be to double-click them. Instead you could also highlight one or multiple icons
  and choose "<i>Open</i>" from the "<i>Edit</i>" menu, or press <i>RETURN</i> alternatively. To open images,
  an external tool is needed to edit the provided bitmap data. First make sure some image editor capable of 
  bitmaps (BMP) is installed. Then use the "<i>Options</i>" dialog to choose your preferred application.
  Another way may be to drag'n'drop bitmap images directly into s1res. This action depends on the source
  filename and replaces the first equal named resource automatically. A quick way to apply new themes to
  your player since you could drag'n'drop a whole bunch of files at once.
  </p>

<h4>How to edit string resources?</h4>
<p>Just select the string resource in the left window and the right window will display one or more strings.
  Multiple strings represent the same expression for different languages. To edit one entry, just
  select the appropriate line and press the left mouse button or <i>RETURN</i>. Inside edit mode,
  the status bar displays the number of available characters. The total amount is limited for each string.
  If you need more space then try to delete characters from an unused language entry (just select the string and press <i>DEL</i>).
  </p>
<p>With v3.4, s1res supports several multi-byte character code-pages. E.g. to edit some russian text, first select the proper code page.
  In this case go to the "<i>Select Code Page</i>" item inside the "<i>Edit</i>" menu and choose "<i>Cyrillic (1251)</i>".
  Now you should be able to edit string resources using all characters available inside this code page.
  If you want to learn more about windows code pages then please visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_code_page">this page</a>.
  </p>
<p>To edit non-displayable characters you can still use URL-encoded (<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1738">RFC 1738</a>) edit-mode.
  Go to the "<i>Select Code Page</i>" item inside the "<i>Edit</i>" menu and choose "<i>Default (URL-encoded)</i>".
  During edit, non-printable ASCII characters get encoded by a '<i>%</i>'-prefix, followed by a two-digit hexadecimal value,
  representing the <a href="ascii.gif">ASCII-code</a>.
  </p>

<h4>I don't know how to leave s1res?</h4>
<p>Choose "<i>Exit</i>" from the "<i>File</i>" menu or quickly press <i>ALT+F4</i>.</p>
