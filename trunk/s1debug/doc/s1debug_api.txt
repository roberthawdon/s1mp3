
S1MP3 DEBUG API
---------------


The s1mp3 debug API is a small piece of code which stays resident at a fixed memory area.
It provides several debugging functions:
* puts  - output zero-terminated string to host
* putch - output character to host
* puti  - output integer to host
* putui - output unsigned integer to host
* getch - read character from host
* brkpnt - stop execution and notify host of breakpoint (standalone)

The API occupies at least two restart locations:
* 0x30 - execute API function (opcode 0xF7)
* 0x38 - breakpoint (opcode 0xFF)

The code implementation of the API could be located anywhere in ZRAM.
A good choice will be to place it at 0x100..0x2FF for example.


COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL
----------------------

The debug interface provides us with 4 single-directional bits for each direction:
* client -> host: DATA_OUT (bit 5..7, bit 5=MSB), CLK (bit 4)
* host -> client: DATA_OUT (bit 0..2, bit 0=MSB), READY (bit 3)

Basic data exchange protocol:

---client---                    ---host---
set DATA_OUT                    .
toggle CLK                 ->   wait until CLK toggles
.                               get DATA
.                               set DATA_OUT (return answer)
wait until READY toggles   <-   toggle READY
get DATA                        .


Data gets transfered bytewise with a 1bit odd parity prefix (9th bit) in front of each byte sent (8 bits).
The data bytes get transfered with MSB first.

To syncronize the transfer, host and client use a special syncronization protocol:

---client---                    ---host---
send 0x000 (9 zero bits)  ->    if parity error then resync
                                wait until 9 zero bits got received
send 3 bit sync-code      ->    receive sync-code (service number)
while receiving 3 bits    <-    if service gets accepted, echo code

repeat whole sequence
until host returned an
echo
